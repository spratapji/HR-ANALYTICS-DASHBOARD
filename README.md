>>  Project Overview

I created an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to understand employee behavior, monitor attrition trends, and help management make smarter, data-driven decisions.
The goal was to turn raw HR data into a clear visual story — showing why employees leave, which departments are most affected, and what factors drive retention.# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD



>>  Key Highlights

Total Employees: 1,470

Employees Left (Attrition): 237

Attrition Rate: 16.1%

Average Employee Age: 37 years

Average Salary: ₹6.5K

Average Years in Company: 7




>> Insights Discovered

Salary Matters Most – Employees earning below ₹5K showed the highest attrition. This revealed that low pay is one of the biggest reasons for turnover.

Young Talent Leaves Faster – Most employees who left were aged 26–35, the career-building phase where people seek growth and better opportunities.

Early Exit Trend – Attrition was highest during the first 2 years of joining. This showed the need for better onboarding and engagement programs.

Top Roles Affected – Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives had the highest attrition, possibly due to heavy workload or limited growth paths.

Education Influence – Employees with Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds showed more movement compared to others.

Gender Difference – Male attrition (143) was higher than female (80), indicating possible role distribution or industry-related imbalance.




>> Tools & Techniques Used

Microsoft Power BI – To design, visualize, and publish the dashboard.

Excel – For data cleaning and transformation before importing into Power BI.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – To create custom KPIs like Attrition Rate, Average Salary, and Years of Experience.

Used bar charts, donut charts, and KPI cards for storytelling visualization.




>> What I Learned

How to convert raw HR data into actionable insights.

Designing a professional dashboard layout that’s clean, interactive, and insightful.

Creating calculated measures using DAX to make dynamic reports.

How HR analytics can directly help companies improve retention and employee satisfaction.




>> Conclusion

This project gave me a deep understanding of how data visualization can solve real HR challenges.
The dashboard doesn’t just show numbers — it tells a story about people, their motivations, and areas where the company can grow.
It’s a perfect example of how analytics can bridge the gap between data and decisions.
