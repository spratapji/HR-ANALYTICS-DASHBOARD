ðŸ§© Project Overview

I created an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to understand employee behavior, monitor attrition trends, and help management make smarter, data-driven decisions.
The goal was to turn raw HR data into a clear visual story â€” showing why employees leave, which departments are most affected, and what factors drive retention.# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD

ðŸ’¡  Insights Discovered

Salary Matters Most â€“ Employees earning below â‚¹5K showed the highest attrition. This revealed that low pay is one of the biggest reasons for turnover.

Young Talent Leaves Faster â€“ Most employees who left were aged 26â€“35, the career-building phase where people seek growth and better opportunities.

Early Exit Trend â€“ Attrition was highest during the first 2 years of joining. This showed the need for better onboarding and engagement programs.

Top Roles Affected â€“ Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives had the highest attrition, possibly due to heavy workload or limited growth paths.

Education Influence â€“ Employees with Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds showed more movement compared to others.

Gender Difference â€“ Male attrition (143) was higher than female (80), indicating possible role distribution or industry-related imbalance.
